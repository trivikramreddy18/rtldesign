# 1. 🛣️ Routing in Physical Design

Routing is one of the final and most important stages of physical design.

After placement and Clock Tree Synthesis, the design contains:

- Standard cells
- Macros
- Pins
- Clock network
- Power connections

However, these components still need physical metal connections.

Routing creates the required interconnections between the placed components.

### 🔹 Basic Flow

### 🔹 Routing connects

```text
Cell A ─────────────── Cell B
       Metal Interconnect
```

The router determines suitable paths through the available routing resources.

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Routing converts logical connections into physical metal interconnections.**

---

# 2. 🧩 Routing Challenges

Routing is not simply connecting two points with a straight line.

The router must consider several physical constraints.

### 🔹 Important Routing Constraints

- Available routing tracks
- Metal layers
- Existing wires
- Cell locations
- Pin locations
- Design rules
- Congestion
- Routing resources

A simplified routing problem can be represented as:

```text
             Destination
                  ●
                  │
          ┌───────┼────────┐
          │       │        │
          │   Obstacles    │
          │    █████       │
          │    █████       │
          │                │
          └────────────────┘
                  │
                  ●
               Source
```

The router must find a legal path while avoiding obstacles and respecting physical design rules.

### 💡 Key Idea

> **A good routing solution must satisfy connectivity as well as physical design constraints.**

---

# 3. 🧭 Maze Routing

Maze routing is a routing technique used to find a path between a source and destination while avoiding obstacles.

The routing area can be represented as a grid.

```text
┌───┬───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ S │   │   │   │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤
│   │ █ │ █ │   │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤
│   │   │ █ │   │   │
├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤
│   │   │   │   │ D │
└───┴───┴───┴───┴───┘

S = Source
D = Destination
█ = Obstacle
```

The router searches through available locations until a connection is found.

### 🔹 General Process

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
Explore Available Locations
  │
  ▼
Avoid Obstacles
  │
  ▼
Reach Destination
  │
  ▼
Create Route
```

Maze routing is useful for understanding how routing algorithms search for paths through a constrained physical space.

---

# 4. 🔍 Lee's Algorithm

**Lee's algorithm** is a classical maze-routing algorithm.

It uses a grid-based search to find a path between two points.

### 🔹 Basic Concept

```text
Start
  │
  ▼
Assign Distance
  │
  ▼
Expand to Neighbouring Cells
  │
  ▼
Continue Expansion
  │
  ▼
Reach Destination
  │
  ▼
Trace Back the Path
```

The search expands through available grid locations.

A simplified example:

```text
┌───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 1 │ █ │ 3 │ 4 │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │
├───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │ D │
└───┴───┴───┴───┘
```

### 🔹 Important Characteristics

- Grid-based routing
- Expands through neighbouring locations
- Avoids blocked locations
- Finds a valid path
- Can be used as a basis for maze-routing concepts

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Lee's algorithm searches the routing space systematically to find a path between two points.**

---

# 5. 📐 Design Rule Check

**Design Rule Check (DRC)** verifies whether the physical layout follows the manufacturing rules of the technology.

For the SKY130 technology, the layout must satisfy the required design rules.

### 🔹 Examples of Physical Rules

Design rules can relate to:

- Metal width
- Metal spacing
- Via placement
- Layer interactions
- Minimum dimensions
- Manufacturing constraints

A simplified example:

```text
Metal A
════════════════

<-- Required Spacing -->

Metal B
════════════════
```

If the spacing is too small:

```text
❌ DRC Violation
```

If the spacing satisfies the required rule:

```text
✅ DRC Clean
```

### 🔹 Why DRC is Important

DRC helps ensure that the generated physical layout is suitable according to the technology's manufacturing constraints.

### 💡 Key Idea

> **DRC checks whether the physical layout follows the technology design rules.**

---

# 6. ⚡ Power Distribution Network

A digital circuit contains a large number of cells that require power.

Therefore, power must be distributed throughout the chip using a dedicated power network.

This is called the **Power Distribution Network (PDN)**.

### 🔹 Simplified PDN

```text
                 VDD
                  │
        ══════════╪══════════
                  │
        ║         │         ║
        ║         │         ║
        ║       Cells       ║
        ║         │         ║
        ║         │         ║
        ══════════╪══════════
                  │
                 VSS
```

The power network distributes:

- VDD
- VSS / GND

throughout the design.

### 🔹 Purpose

The power network should provide reliable power connections to the cells across the chip.

### 💡 Key Idea

> **PDN provides the physical power and ground distribution required by the design.**

---

# 7. 🔋 Power Straps

Power straps are wide metal structures used to distribute power across the chip.

A simplified representation is:

```text
      VDD STRAP
════════════════════════════

│       │       │       │
│       │       │       │
│       │       │       │
│       │       │       │

════════════════════════════
      VSS STRAP
```

Power straps are part of the overall power distribution network.

### 🔹 Why Power Straps are Used

They help:

- Distribute power across the layout
- Connect different regions of the chip
- Provide low-resistance power paths
- Support the power requirements of standard cells

### 🔹 Power Distribution

```text
Power Source
     │
     ▼
Power Grid
     │
     ▼
Power Straps
     │
     ▼
Standard Cells
```

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Power straps form an important part of the physical power network across the chip.**

---

# 8. 🌐 Global Routing

Global routing is the stage where the router determines the **general paths** that connections should follow.

It does not necessarily determine every exact wire segment.

Instead, it plans how the connections should move through the available routing resources.

### 🔹 Concept

```text
Source
  │
  ▼
┌───────────────┐
│ Routing Area  │
│               │
│   ────────┐   │
│           │   │
│           └───┼──► Destination
│               │
└───────────────┘
```

### 🔹 Global Routing Considers

- Routing resources
- Congestion
- Routing regions
- Connectivity
- General path selection

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Global routing creates a high-level routing plan before exact physical wires are created.**

---

# 9. 🎯 Detailed Routing

Detailed routing follows the global-routing plan and determines the actual physical interconnects.

It deals with the exact routing resources available in the layout.

### 🔹 Detailed Routing

```text
Global Route
     │
     ▼
Exact Routing Tracks
     │
     ▼
Metal Segments
     │
     ▼
Vias
     │
     ▼
Physical Connection
```

The detailed router must obey the technology design rules while creating the final connections.

### 🔹 Detailed Routing Deals With

- Exact routing tracks
- Metal layers
- Via locations
- Wire segments
- Design-rule constraints
- Connectivity

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Detailed routing converts the global routing plan into actual physical wires and vias.**

---

# 10. 🔄 Global vs Detailed Routing

Global routing and detailed routing perform different tasks.

| Feature | Global Routing | Detailed Routing |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Purpose | Planning | Exact implementation |
| Path | General | Exact |
| Tracks | Approximate resources | Specific tracks |
| Wires | Not fully finalized | Physical wires |
| Vias | Not fully finalized | Actual vias |
| DRC | Preliminary consideration | Strictly checked |
| Output | Routing plan | Physical routing |

### 🔹 Overall Routing Flow

```text

           └────────┬────────┘
                    ▼
             Final Layout
```

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Global routing plans the route, while detailed routing implements the exact physical route.**

---

# 11. 🛠️ TritonRoute

**TritonRoute** is a detailed-routing component used in the OpenROAD physical-design flow.

Its role is to create detailed physical connections after earlier physical-design stages have been completed.

### 🔹 Simplified Flow

---

# 13. 🧠 Routing Algorithms & Topology

Routing requires algorithms to determine suitable paths and topologies between connected pins.

A routing topology describes the structure used to connect multiple points.

### 🔹 Simple Topology

```text
             Pin A
               │
               │
Pin B ─────────┼──────── Pin C
               │
               │
             Pin D
```

The router needs to determine an efficient physical structure for the required connections.

### 🔹 Routing Algorithm

A routing algorithm determines:

```text
Where to route
      ↓
Which direction to take
      ↓
Which routing resources to use
      ↓
How to avoid obstacles
      ↓
How to satisfy design rules
```

### 🔹 Important Routing Goals

A routing solution should aim for:

- Valid connectivity
- Efficient routing
- Reduced congestion
- Design-rule compliance
- Suitable routing topology

### 💡 Key Idea

> **Routing algorithms determine how connections are physically constructed while respecting available resources and constraints.**
